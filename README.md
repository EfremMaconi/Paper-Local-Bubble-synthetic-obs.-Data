# Data

The compressed file ... contains the data, i.e. gas number density, gas temperature, magnetic fields (Bx,By,Bz), for the Local Bubble candidate presented in the Paper: 'Synthetic dust polarization emission maps at 353 GHz for an observer placed inside a Local Bubble like cavity', E.Maconi et al. ([1]).

These data are part of the SILCC Project; for more information see

To extract the data, use the Python script ..., written by Philipp Girichidis. 

Once the data are extracted, you can use the radiative transfer code POLARIS (here is the website: https://portia.astrophysik.uni-kiel.de/polaris/ ) to produce synthetic polarization maps and analyze them as described in Paper [1].
